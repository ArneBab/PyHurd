Mercurial
---------

PyHurd uses Mercurial for version tracking. 

For unstable development we use feature branches. 

When a feature is finished, just merge the corresponding revision into the default branch: 

	hg update default
	hg merge feature-x
	hg ci -m "merged feature X into default"

Merge default into unstable as often as possible.

To start a new feature, 

1. first start a new branch with the name of the feature starting from default. 
2. Then commit away and push whenever you finish something which might be of interest to 
others, regardless how marginal. 
3. When your feature is stable, merge it into default.
4. When the feature is done and needs no more work, close the branch.

	hg up default # start from default, automatic when using a fresh clone
	hg branch feature-x
	# do some changes
	hg commit -m "started feature X" 
	hg push 

	# commit and push as you want

	hg update default
	hg merge feature-x
	hg ci -m "merged feadure X into default"

	hg ci --close-branch -m "finished feature X"

To improve a feature after it was officially closed, first merge default into the feature branch 
(to get it up to date), then work just as if you had started it.

	hg up feature-x
	hg merge default
	hg ci -m "merged default into feature X"
	# commit, push, repeat, finish

Generally merge default into your feature as often as possible.
