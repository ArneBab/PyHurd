PyHurd - Pytonish GNU/Hurd

PyHurd is an attempt to create full binding to GNU/Hurd API.
It will include bindings to various GNU/Hurd libraries and 
will have ability to create translators with python language.

At this moment we're using Mercurial.
There's two repositories (you know that's the Mercurial ;-) :
  1. http://freehg.org/u/ArneBab/pyhurd/
  2. http://freehg.org/u/AnatolyKazantsev/pyhurd/

To get a local copy of this repositories run command:
  hg clone url_above

Please, send any comments, suggestions, ideas and patches to anatoly@gnu.org
